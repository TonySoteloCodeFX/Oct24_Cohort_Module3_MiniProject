<hr>

<h4>5. Error Handling:</h4>

<li>Apply error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to manage unexpected issues that may arise during execution.</li>

<hr>

<h4>6. GitHub Repository:</h4>

<li>Create a GitHub repository for your project.</li>

<li>Create a clean and interactive README.md file in your GitHub repository.</li>

<li>Include clear instructions on how to run the application and explanations of its features.</li>

<h6>NOTE:</h6> 
Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, print statements, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
